  For your weekend challenge, you will need to create an application that records employee data, including their salary. We also want to add the salaries up so we know how much weâ€™re spending each month. Start with the forms folder in the github repo provided.

Setup
You may begin from the code in the forms folder. This contains the input fields and the code to process the input into an object.

You will need to download and source in the jQuery library!

Base Functionality

The application should first have an input form that collects:</p>

<p><b> The Employee's First and Last name
The Employee's ID Number
The Employee's Job Title
The Employee's Salary (Yearly)
The form should have a submit button that

clears out the form and
stores the submitted information.</b> </p>

<p>
Then, that information should be appended to the DOM so the user of the application can see the information they just entered.

Finally, your logic should calculate all of the employee salaries and report back what the monthly cost of salaries is.
</p>
